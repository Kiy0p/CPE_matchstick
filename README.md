# CPE_matchstick

This is a 1st year Epitech project coded in C.

The goal was to make a matchstick game. You play vs an AI and the last one to pick up a matchstick looses.
To pay, give the binary two numbers, the first one is the number of levels the game contains, the second one is the max number of matches players can pick up in one turn.

Have fun and don't forget to star!
